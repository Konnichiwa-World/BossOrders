# My first reference project : BossOrders

This Project has:

+ ASP.NET Core
+ .NET 6 (used Visual Studio 2022)
+ MVC.
+ Admin Panel
+ Api Token
+ CRUD Operations
+ Login Operations
+ Authorization Operations
+ Used SQL SERVER (Windows Authentication)

In Addition;
If you want to be first admin, enter the SQL SERVER, change "user" to "admin". You will be admin. Later you can use like admin.

The working scenario of the project;

Company employees log in to the system with the user name and password they have determined, and can see the orders of the admin (boss). He can delete and change the orders he has made. The boss, like other members, can interfere with orders. Also, admin can add and delete members. Members can be admin or user. Only admin can give orders.

(I know html & css, but I didn't need to put a frontend, after all, it's a backend project.)
